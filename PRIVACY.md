# Privacy Policy - Spending Tracker

**Last Updated: 26 December 2025**

## The Simple Truth

**I don't collect, store, or see any of your data. Period.**

## How Your Data Works

### Everything Stays on Your Device
- All your spending data is stored **only in your browser** using IndexedDB (a local database)
- Your data **never leaves your device**
- There is **no server**, no backend, no database I control
- I cannot see your transactions, balances, or any information

### Your Data is Private to Your Browser
- Each browser has its own separate database
- Your Chrome data ≠ Your Safari data ≠ Your Firefox data
- Even on the same device, different browsers = different data
- No one else can see your data, not even me

### What This Means
✅ **Your data is 100% private**  
✅ **No tracking or analytics**  
✅ **No cookies** (except browser's own storage for the app to work)  
✅ **No third parties**  
✅ **No user accounts or passwords needed**  

⚠️ **Important:** Your data is tied to your specific browser on your specific device. If you clear your browser data or use a different browser/device, you'll lose access to your spending records.

## What I DON'T Do

I don't:
- ❌ Collect any personal information
- ❌ Track your usage
- ❌ Use analytics tools
- ❌ Share data with anyone (because I don't have it!)
- ❌ Store passwords or login credentials
- ❌ Use ads or marketing trackers
- ❌ Sync data across devices

## Data Deletion

Want to delete your data?
- Clear your browser's data/cache for this website
- Or use your browser's developer tools to clear IndexedDB
- Or just uninstall/stop using the app

Your data is deleted immediately from your device. I have nothing to delete on my end because I never had it.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

If you install this as a PWA (Progressive Web App) on your phone or desktop:
- Data still stays only on that device
- No internet connection needed after installation
- Uninstalling the app deletes all local data

## Changes to This Policy

If I ever change how this works (which would require completely rebuilding the app), I'll update this policy and the "Last Updated" date.

## Questions?

This app is open source. You can inspect the code yourself to verify that no data leaves your device.

**In Plain English:** This is a calculator that lives in your browser. Just like a calculator doesn't send your calculations anywhere, this app doesn't send your spending data anywhere. It's completely private.
